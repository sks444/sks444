Hey! I am a backend developer with 4+ years of experience in building softwares with Python, Django and Wagtail.

My most recent work was with [RemoteInning](https://www.remoteinning.com/); Where I worked as a core developer for [OpenTechFund](https://www.opentech.fund/) and [ItalyMondo!](https://italymondo.com/) but also helped out other partners like [TheMotelyFool](https://www.fool.com/) and [CIGI](https://www.opentech.fund/) from time to time.

Before RemoteInning, I worked at Appknox and before that I was part of [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) programm in 2018, working again with Python and Django for the most part.
